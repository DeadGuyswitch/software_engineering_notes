# Software Development Models 

## 1. Waterfall 

- Introduced by Winston Royce in 1970
### Features
- Consists of a series of steps that must be completed sequentially
- Completion of each step produces an output (document or artifact) that is consumed by the next step 
- Major steps
    - **Requirement Collection**:  \
    Capture user's requirement, analyze them, and produce a requirements document
    - **Design**: \
        Plan the system's design using the requirements document. Two levels of design: ***Logical System Design*** - Plan out the high level components and ***Physical System Design*** - Select appropriate technologies and hardware 
    - **Implementation**: Transform design documents created in previous steps into actual code 
    - **Verificiation**: Ensure that the produced system meets all the user's requirements 
    - **Maintenance**: This is required once the user starts using the produced software 

### Pros
- Implementing the system is much simpler for engineers as requirements are defined beforehand 
- Estimation of time and cost is easy because of predefined requirements 

### Cons
- Each stage is defined in an abstract way, exposing no detail about the project management and quality control processes 
- While it may work for small and medium size projects, it is less likely to be a good model for large scale projects 
- Customer requirements can be constantly changing during the project implementation. This approach is less flexible in this regard
- Gathering the requirements beforehand can be time consuming
